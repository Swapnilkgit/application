üî• Basic Git Concepts
What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system to track changes in source code during software development.

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a VCS tool; GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.

What is the difference between Git and SVN?
Git is distributed; SVN is centralized. Git works offline; SVN requires network access for many tasks.

How do you check the Git version?
git --version

What is a repository in Git?
A repository (repo) is a directory that contains your project‚Äôs files and the full history of changes.

What is the difference between local and remote repositories?
Local repo is on your system. Remote repo (e.g., GitHub) is on the server.

How do you initialize a Git repository?
git init

üöÄ Day-to-Day Git Commands
How do you clone a repository?
git clone <repo_url>

How do you check the status of a repo?
git status

How do you add files to staging area?
git add <filename> or git add .

How do you commit changes?
git commit -m "Your message"

How do you push changes to remote repo?
git push origin <branch_name>

How do you pull changes from remote repo?
git pull origin <branch_name>

How do you view commit history?
git log

How do you view a single-line summary of commits?
git log --oneline

üõ†Ô∏è Branching and Merging
How do you create a new branch?
git branch <branch_name>

How do you switch to another branch?
git checkout <branch_name>
OR
git switch <branch_name> (newer Git)

How do you create and switch to a new branch in one command?
git checkout -b <branch_name>

How do you merge two branches?
git checkout main
git merge feature_branch

How do you delete a branch locally?
git branch -d <branch_name>

What is a fast-forward merge?
A merge where HEAD just moves forward, with no merge commit.

What is a three-way merge?
Merge with a common ancestor when branches have diverged.

What is the difference between merge and rebase?
Merge creates a new commit combining branches; rebase moves or reapplies commits on top of another base.

üßπ Undoing and Fixing Mistakes
How do you undo last commit but keep changes staged?
git reset --soft HEAD~1

How do you undo last commit and unstage changes?
git reset --mixed HEAD~1

How do you discard local changes in a file?
git checkout -- <filename> (old) or git restore <filename> (new)

How do you remove a file from Git but keep it locally?
git rm --cached <filename>

How do you revert a commit?
git revert <commit_hash>

Difference between reset, revert, and checkout?

reset: undo commits or unstage files.

revert: create a new commit to reverse an older one.

checkout: move between branches or revert files.

üåê Remote Repositories
How do you add a remote repository?
git remote add origin <repo_url>

How do you see remotes?
git remote -v

How do you fetch changes without merging?
git fetch

Difference between git fetch and git pull?

fetch: downloads but doesn‚Äôt merge

pull: fetch + merge

üß† Advanced Git Concepts
What is the HEAD in Git?
HEAD is a pointer to the current branch reference or latest commit.

What is a detached HEAD?
When HEAD points to a specific commit, not a branch.

What is a stash in Git?
Temporarily shelves changes not ready to commit.
git stash, git stash apply

How do you tag a commit?
git tag v1.0

How do you create an annotated tag?
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"

How do you delete a remote tag?
git push --delete origin <tag_name>

üß© Conflicts and Collaboration
What causes a merge conflict?
When two branches have changes in the same part of a file.

How do you resolve merge conflicts?
Manually edit files, then git add and git commit

How do you prevent merge conflicts?

Pull before pushing

Communicate with team

Smaller commits

How do you squash commits?
git rebase -i HEAD~n and mark as squash

Difference between origin/master and master?

master: local branch

origin/master: remote-tracking branch

üìÅ Git Configuration and Hooks
How do you configure Git globally?
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

Where is Git config stored?

Local: .git/config

Global: ~/.gitconfig

What are Git hooks?
Scripts that run on Git events (e.g., pre-commit, post-merge)

Have you worked with Git hooks? Example?
Yes. Used pre-commit to run lint checks before allowing commits.

üìä Performance & Best Practices
How do you reduce Git repo size?

Remove large files with git filter-branch or BFG

Use .gitignore wisely

Best practices in Git for teams?

Use feature branches

Write meaningful commit messages

Rebase before merge

Code reviews before pull requests
